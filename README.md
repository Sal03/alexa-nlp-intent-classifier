# Alexa NLP Intent Classifier

This project integrates a custom-built NLP intent classifier using Hugging Face Transformers with an Alexa Skill via Flask and Ngrok. It enables Alexa to understand open-ended user inputs like _"I need help with my order"_ and classify them into predefined intents such as `get_product`, `ask_offer`, `track_order`, and `ask_help`.
